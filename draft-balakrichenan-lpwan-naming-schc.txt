1.  Introduction

   [RFC8376]  states that the goal of the LPWAN WG is to, where
   necessary, adapt IETF-defined protocols, addressing schemes, and
   naming conventions to this particular constrained environment.

   [RFC0830]  specifies that realization of Internet Naming Convention
   requires the establishment of both naming authority and name service.

   This document describes how the Internet naming convention, i.e. the
   domain names and the Internet naming authority and service, i.e. the
   DNS could be use in LPWAN constrained scenarios.

2.  Motivation

   There are multiple stakeholders involved in onboarding a device in
   the typical LPWAN eco-system.  The stakeholders range from device
   manufacturers to device owners to the network service provider to the
   application service provider.

   In LoRa, the device is called "generic device", when the device is
   configured with the parameters such as DevEUI (IEEE EUI64 identifier
   which uniquely identifies the device), the JoinEUI (IEEE EUI64
   identifier which uniquely identifies the application server) and the
   cryptographic keys for securing the communication.

3.  Terminology

4.  IPv6 address fields

   As in 6LoWPAN [RFC4944], IPv6 addresses are split into two 64-bit
   long fields; one for the prefix and one for the Interface Identifier
   (IID).  These fields SHOULD be compressed.  To allow for a single

   Rule being used for both directions, these values are identified by
   their role (DEV or APP) and not by their position in the header
   (source or destination).

5.  Different types of Interface Identifiers (IID)

   In LoRaWAN, there are different types of identifiers : DevEUI,
   JoinEUI, AppEUI.  All these information are sent as part of the
   packet header.
