   <section title="Introduction">
	<t> 
	<xref target="RFC8376"/>  states that the goal of
	the LPWAN WG is to, where necessary, adapt IETF-defined protocols,
   	addressing schemes, and naming conventions to this particular
   	constrained environment. 
	</t>

     	<t> 
	<xref target="RFC0830"/>  specifies that realization of Internet Naming
	Convention requires the establishment of both naming authority and name service.
     	</t>

	<t> 
	This document describes how the Internet naming convention, i.e. the
	domain names and the Internet naming authority and service, i.e. the DNS could
	be use in LPWAN constrained scenarios.  
	</t>
 </section>
  
  <section title="Motivation"> 
      	<t>
	There are multiple stakeholders involved in onboarding a device in the typical
	LPWAN eco-system. The stakeholders range from device manufacturers to device
	owners to the network service provider to the application service provider. 
	</t>

	<t>
	In LoRa, the device is called "generic device", when the device is configured
	with the parameters such as DevEUI (IEEE EUI64 identifier which uniquely
	identifies the device), the JoinEUI (IEEE EUI64 identifier which uniquely
	identifies the application server) and the cryptographic keys for securing the
	communication.  
	</t>
   </section>

   <section title="Terminology">
     <t> </t> 
   </section>
   
   <section title="IPv6 address fields">
     	<t>  
	As in 6LoWPAN [RFC4944], IPv6 addresses are split into two 64-bit long
	fields; one for the prefix and one for the Interface Identifier (IID).  These
	fields SHOULD be compressed.  To allow for a single Rule being used for both
	directions, these values are identified by their role (DEV or APP) and not by
	their position in the header (source or destination).
	</t>
   </section>

   <section title="Different types of Interface Identifiers (IID)">
     	<t>
	 In LoRaWAN, there are different types of identifiers : DevEUI, JoinEUI,
	AppEUI. All these information are sent as part of the packet header.
